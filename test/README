This 'test' directory is intended to serve for regression testing.

Expected output folders of tests are supposed to be placed under 
cmp/ (e.g. cmp/gentest.cmp). Corresponding test runs should be done
under run/ (e.g. run/gentest.run). The run folder is ignored by git.

Currently only one test ('gentest') is implemented. It can be easily
run by executing './gentest.sh $EXEC_PATH', where $EXEC_PATH should be
the path of the RPMD executable you want to test. If it is the default
'qmd.x' in RPMD's main directory, you can simply run 'gentest.sh'.
If the test output differs from the expected output, you can find the
diff in 'run/gentest.diff'.
