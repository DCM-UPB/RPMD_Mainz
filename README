Flexible Water with Multiple Time Steps and Beadiabatic:
--------------------------------------------------------

dvdr holds low frequency forces
dvdr2 holds high frequency forces.

RP Contraction:
----------------
Splits the LJ and ewald from the intramolecular force and uses RP contraction on them.

07-03-08: Split LJ into a new subroutine. Beadiabatic forces routine is now passed iopt which determines which part of the force routine to perform beadiabatic separation on.

3 Split (3s) version : uses a different number of normal modes for the ewald sum as for the LJ.

10_03_07 : added rg routine static properties calculation

10_03_07_05 : beadd stores and repaces r rather than backwards FT.

11_03: added normal mode as primitive represenation (evolve_nm) which dramatically speeds up the beadiabatic program when used with large multiple time steps (e.g. MTS=5 or MTS=10) since it reduces the FTs from 44 per timestep to 23 at MTS=1 and 8 per timestep to 5 per timestep at MTS = 1. Beadiabatic evolution also incorporated into normal mode primtive scheme using beadd_forces_nm subroutine which takes in positions in normal mode rep and produces normal mode forces.

13_03 : RDF speeded up

13_03_p : Program now reads parameters from a parameter file. Code tidied up using ftnchek. mts is now in input file.

16_03 : Output of <vinter>,<vintra>,<tintra>,<tinter> seperately. Improved handling of exact estimators.

02_04: Added output of ewald and LJ energies seperately.

03_04: CHANGE IN ORDERING OF BEADD NORMAL MODE FREQUENCIES

14_05 : Program code cleaned up.

20_04: OCF for Classical fixed. ACMD evolution added.

01_05: Smeared Charge Ewald intermolecular and Fourth Order Morse intramolecular added.

06-05-f : Ice starting configuration. FCC initial lattice and non-cubic ewald.

12-05 : OCF problems fixed

30-05 : Linked cell list for LJ - used when nm = 700 or above.

09-06 : Major speed improvements in LJ evaluation and electrostatic contraction scheme. For large systems a linked cell list is used to create the neighbour list.

26-06 : Added knowledge of M-site to electrostatic RP contraction. Note:// still cannot use smeared charges with electrostatic contraction scheme in this version. Renamed to water_'date' from water_bea_nm_'date'-demwald.

03-07 : Minor changes. Param file now contains masses.

08-07 : tem RP electrostatic contraction implemented. Replacing dem method (although routines still included)

09-07 : Minor fixes to problems that stopped earlier versions comiling correctly using g77. Final version written in g77 :-(.

09-07-f90 : Program converted to take advantage of fortran 90. Allocatable arrays used allowing  the use of large system sizes. Globals.inc no longer contains fixed size array parameters.

3-08 : Non-cubic linked cell list for non-cubic LJ and rwald.

4-08 : Non-cubic smeared charges added. Pressure calculation and Berendsen barostat.

5-08 : Cubic pressure calculation added. RP contraction NPT now working.

31-08 : Interface setup, Non-isotropic berendsen barostat, Option for harmonic bend with anharmonic stretch.

05-09 : Rigid water evolution added for NVT. Rigid virial not yet complete.

08-09 : Rigid NPT complete.

09-09 : Buckingham O-O interaction added.

16_09im : A few small problems removed and unneccesary variables culled.

13-10 : Dielectric constant calculation error corrected. RDF calculation and exact estimators now controlled by switches in input file.

14-10 : Improved SHAKE/RATTLE routine. Also fixed crashingof classical simualtions when beadiabatic paramaters set and density profile error in the melting routine.

16-10 : Parinello global thermostat implemented for classical rigid and flexible simulations. Parinello local thermostat also availiable : for relative merits see Comput. Phys. Comm. 179 (2008) p26-29.

5-11 : Additional NPT and pressure properties calculated by md_static routine. Fixed bug in rigid classical barostat.

29-01-09 : MAJOR sampling fix done!

23-02-09 : Changed to Fortran 90

Possible Future additions:
---------------------------

1.) Inclusion of Solute atoms/molecule.
2.) RP electrostatic contraction for smeared charges.
3.) NPT simulation / pressure calculation.
4.) Polarizability.
5.) Generalize solvent treatment.
