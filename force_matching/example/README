# Example of force field matching

In this example directory you can find some fiels that will allow you to
perform a demonstrative force field fitting. This includes the file ´input´,
which contains the necessary configuration options for the RPMD code and both
a short trajectory file and a corresponding reference ab-initio force file.
Just execute the following steps:

1) Compile the RPMD code adapted for force field calculation, by switching to
   the code directory (`cd ../src`) and running `make`. Note that the provided
   Makefile assumes the usage of gfortran and hence needs to be adapted for
   other compilers, although likely the code will not compile with a different
   compiler anyway.

2) Copy the resulting executable `wff.x` to this example directory.

3) Run the linked force-matchign script with the following minimal command-line
   call:
   `python fmatch.py --natom 375 --ndata 100 --traj example_positions.xyz --frcs example_forces.frc`
   Check the printed usage information for all the possible options to the script.
   Especially noteworthy is possibility to set a lower boundary on the oo_eps
   parameter, which in turn prevents oo_sig from growing too big (default <=10).

4) Extract the fit result either from the optimization report of the script or
   from the file `params_fit`, which is the params file used to run the force
   code in the last optimization step.
